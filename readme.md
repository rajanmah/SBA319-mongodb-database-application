# SBA 219 MongoDB Server Application
### I have used 'sample_supplies' from mongoDB sample database to apply CRUD operations to its 'sales' data using mongoDB and express. I used 'reqbin.com' and "Postman" platform to test CRUD Operatons. 
### I have created routes for CRUD operations and tested index route, get one data route, create one route, update one data route and delete one data route.
### I also created data validation rules to validate the data newly entered in the sales collection.
